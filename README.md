# Space Invaders

My CS50 final project (and personal first project) is called Space Invaders.
Space Invaders is a game written with lua/l√∂ve2d, in Space Invaders the player is the spaceship at the bottom
of the screen and can move left and right with their respective arrow keys on your keyboard,
and has to defend against waves of enemies by shooting lasers at them using the space key, the player has 3 health
and loses 1 health if an enemy collides with them or for each 5 enemies missed, thr game will keep track of your score,
missed enemies and health in the top left corner of the screen, after losing all your health,
a game over screen will pop up with a slightly different background and it will display the player's final score,
afterwards you can press R to restart the game with score, missed enemies and health reset.
